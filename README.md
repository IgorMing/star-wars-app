# Star wars app

This is a simple app just showing a little bit some skill with react, react native and Javascript in general.

To start the project is pretty simple. Just follow the instructions below and let's to it.

Firstly, just clone the project
```
git clone git@github.com:IgorMing/star-wars-app.git
```

Go into the project folder, and install the dependencies
```
cd star-wars-app && yarn // or npm i
```

Now, we just need to run it
```
yarn start
```

...oh, and to run the simple tests that I'd created, just run
```
yarn test
```

Some observations
-

* On this project, I used some concepts I like, like [redux ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for each redux module.

* I didn't use any visual library. Everything was created with css in js.

* I didn't have time to do all features, but I made something simple, just to expose to you, guys, my code pattern and my pragmatism.

* I've been created unit tests just for the Header component. I know the importance of tests, I'm sorry to do not cover the major part from the project with tests.

* I used some ES7 features, including even [Experimental decorators](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-decorators/). I'm not a hipster guy, I just consider it nice to use in a skill test. And also the syntax become cleaner. :)

* This entire project was created from my [own boilerplate](https://github.com/IgorMing/react-native-boilerplate). I'm used to create boilerplates to help me to start my development. It's the same with [React web boilerplate](https://github.com/IgorMing/react-basic-boilerplate).

* Finally, everything was developed with my dear [code snippet for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=igorming.useful-react-snippets)

That's it!
Thank you, cheers!
